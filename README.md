# C Programming Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my **C Programming Learning Repository**! This repo contains the C programs I wrote while learning C for the first time. These programs cover fundamental concepts, basic algorithms, and problem-solving techniques that helped me grasp the core ideas of the C language.

## ðŸ“Œ About
This repository serves as a personal archive of my C coding journey. It includes:
- Basic syntax and structure of C
- Control flow statements (loops, if-else, switch)
- Functions and recursion
- Arrays and pointers
- Strings and file handling
- Data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, etc.)

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
```
/        # Root directory
â”œâ”€â”€ basics/        # Simple programs (Hello World, variables, loops, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ functions/     # Programs using functions and recursion
â”œâ”€â”€ arrays/        # Programs related to arrays and multidimensional arrays
â”œâ”€â”€ pointers/      # Pointer concepts and applications
â”œâ”€â”€ strings/       # String manipulation programs
â”œâ”€â”€ data_structures/ # Linked lists, stacks, queues, and sorting algorithms
â””â”€â”€ projects/      # Small projects or problem-solving exercises
```

## ðŸ’» How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired program directory:
   ```bash
   cd basics
   ```
3. Compile and run a program using GCC:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o filename
   ./filename
   ```

## âœ¨ Why This Repository?
- To track my progress in C programming ðŸ“ˆ
- To help beginners understand basic C concepts ðŸ“š
- To revisit and improve my old codes over time ðŸ”„

## ðŸ”¥ Future Plans
- Add more complex problem-solving programs
- Optimize existing code for better efficiency
- Document explanations for each program
